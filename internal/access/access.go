// Package access answers a narrower question than the geolocation checks: not
// "which country does this service think I am in", but "will it actually serve
// me". The two differ more often than expected — a service can geolocate you
// correctly and still refuse, because the exit address belongs to a hosting
// provider, or because the catalogue in that region is partial.
//
// Each check probes the endpoint the service's own clients use and reads the
// specific marker it returns, rather than inferring availability from a status
// code alone.
//
// The probes are ported from the Stash collapsed-tile panel scripts, which is
// why the report groups them under "Stash checks". They are kept apart from the
// geolocation checks on purpose: those ask which country a service assigns you,
// these ask whether it will serve you at all, and the two disagree exactly in
// the cases worth knowing about.
